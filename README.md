# The Cool Mammals Project - Object Detection
This is the repository for the object detection part of the Cool Mammals project. It contains a couple of useful files for data preparation, model training and inference.
A series of blog posts detailing it can be found at [Guacamole Data Science](https://luiztauffer.github.io/guacamole-data-science/posts/2019-03-17-cool-mammals-project/).

After a model is trained and the frozen graph is produced, the folder structure should look like this:

```
- data
- images
  - test
  - train
- pre_trained_model
- trained-inference-graphs
- training
(other files)
```
